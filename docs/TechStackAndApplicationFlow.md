I've structured the tech stack and application flow for the vehicle rental application, divided into the Buyer's app and Seller's app.

### Application Flow

#### 1. Introduction

- **Objective:** To facilitate the rental of vehicles by connecting buyers with sellers through a mobile application.

#### 2. User Stories

- **Buyer's App:**
  - User registration and login
  - Vehicle search and filtering
  - Viewing vehicle details and availability
  - Booking and payment processing
  - Trip history and ratings

- **Seller's App:**
  - Seller registration and login
  - Vehicle listing and details
  - Managing bookings and availability
  - Payment tracking
  - Shop management and analytics

#### 3. Application Architecture

- **Components:**
  - **Frontend (React Native):**
    - Buyer's App
    - Seller's App
  - **Backend (AWS Lambda, API Gateway):**
    - User Authentication
    - Vehicle Management
    - Booking and Payment Processing
  - **Database (DynamoDB):**
    - User Profiles
    - Vehicle Listings
    - Booking History
  - **Storage (S3):**
    - Vehicle Images

- **Communication Flow:**
  - Buyer's App requests vehicle data from the backend via API Gateway.
  - Backend processes requests using Lambda functions, interacts with DynamoDB for data, and sends responses.
  - Seller's App communicates with the backend for managing vehicle listings and handling bookings.

#### 4. User Journey

- **Buyer's App:**
  1. User logs in or registers.
  2. User searches for available vehicles based on location, type, etc.
  3. User selects a vehicle, views details, and checks availability.
  4. User books the vehicle for a specific duration.
  5. Payment is processed securely.
  6. User receives confirmation and access details.

- **Seller's App:**
  1. Seller logs in or registers.
  2. Seller lists their vehicles with details and images.
  3. Seller manages bookings and availability.
  4. Seller views payment details and earnings.
  5. Seller monitors shop analytics and performance.

#### 5. Data Flow

- Data flows between React Native frontend and AWS Lambda backend.
- User profiles, vehicle listings, bookings, and payments are stored in DynamoDB.
- Vehicle images are stored in S3.

#### 6. Error Handling

- Implement error handling in Lambda functions to manage issues during data processing or communication.

#### 7. Security Measures

- Using AWS Cognito for user authentication.
- Securing communication between React Native app and AWS Lambda using HTTPS.
- Implementing secure payment processing.

#### 8. Performance Considerations

- Optimize Lambda functions for performance.
- Use AWS CloudFront for content delivery to enhance React Native app performance.

### Tech Stack

#### 1. Frontend (React Native)

- **Framework:** React Native
- **Languages:** JavaScript, JSX
- **State Management:** Redux or React Context API

#### 2. Backend (AWS Lambda, API Gateway)

- **Serverless:** AWS Lambda
- **API Management:** API Gateway
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito

#### 3. Database (DynamoDB)

- **NoSQL Database:** Amazon DynamoDB

#### 4. Storage (S3)

- **Object Storage:** Amazon S3

#### 5. DevOps and Deployment

- **Version Control:** Git
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild
- **Hosting:** AWS Lambda

#### 6. Testing

- **Unit Testing:** Jest for Lambda functions
- **End-to-End Testing:** Detox for React Native

#### 7. Monitoring and Logging

- **Logging:** AWS CloudWatch Logs
- **Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch Metrics

#### 8. Development Environment

- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
- **AWS CLI:** Command-line interface for AWS management

#### 9. Dependencies

- React Navigation, Axios, AWS SDK for JavaScript (Lambda functions)

### Conclusion

The vehicle rental application leverages the cost-effective serverless architecture of AWS Lambda, ensuring scalability and efficient resource utilization. React Native provides a cross-platform mobile app with a shared codebase for both the Buyer's and Seller's apps. AWS services like DynamoDB, S3, and Cognito enhance data storage, retrieval, and security. Continuous integration and deployment streamline the development process, and monitoring tools ensure application health and performance.
