This USP emphasizes three key pillars that differentiate this application:

The vechilces we offer goes through a strct servicing routine, valid rental licensing acquired from the state government entity and bona fide documents from the vehcile owners. Our platform includes comprehensive vehicle injury insurance, ensuring robust protection and financial coverage in the event of accidents or damages during the rental period. Our insurance package mitigates liabilities for both our customers and the business, providing peace of mind and safeguarding against unforeseen expenses related to vehicle accidents or injuries. This added layer of protection underscores our commitment to safety and responsible rental practices, offering a secure and worry-free experience for all parties involved.

This business model canvas serves as a foundational framework for this vehicle rental application MVP. It's a dynamic tool and needs to be continuously refined and adapt it based on market feedback, changing consumer needs, and industry trends.
