- Users can search for available vehicles based on various criteria (location, type, etc.).
- Detailed vehicle listings will include images, descriptions, and availability.
- Users can book a vehicle for a specified duration.
- Payment processing will be integrated for secure transactions.

#### 3.1.3 Trip History and Ratings

- Users can view their rental history, including past bookings.
- After a trip, users can rate and provide feedback on the rented vehicles.

### 3.2 Seller's App

#### 3.2.1 Seller Registration and Authentication

- Sellers can register with the application as vehicle owners.
- Sellers can log in using their credentials.
- Seller authentication is handled securely using AWS Cognito.

#### 3.2.2 Vehicle Listing and Management

- Backend AWS Lambda functions should handle requests within 500 milliseconds.

### 4.2 Security

- User data, including personal information and payment details, shall be encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Secure communication using HTTPS for all data transfer.

### 4.3 Scalability

- The system should be able to handle a minimum of 10,000 simultaneous users.
- The architecture should scale seamlessly based on demand.

### 4.4 Usability

- The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.
- The application shall support multiple languages.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Frontend

- React Native for cross-platform development.
- Redux or React Context API for state management.
- Axios for API communication.

### 5.2 Backend

- AWS Lambda functions for serverless backend.
- API Gateway for RESTful API communication.
- AWS Cognito for user authentication.

### 5.3 Database

- DynamoDB for user profiles, vehicle listings, and booking details.

### 5.4 Storage

- S3 for storing images of listed vehicles.

## 6. Constraints

- The development budget is limited; therefore, cost-effective solutions, such as serverless architecture, should be prioritized.
- The application development timeline is six months.
